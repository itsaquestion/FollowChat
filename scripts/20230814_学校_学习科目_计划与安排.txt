Jenny:: Guy and Aria meet at school to discuss their class schedule and plan their study subjects.

Guy:: Hi Aria! How's it going?

Aria:: Pretty good, Guy. How about you? Ready for the new semester?

Guy:: Yeah, I guess so. I'm trying to decide which electives to take this term. Any suggestions?

Aria:: Hmm, what are you interested in? Music, arts, language?

Guy:: Well I do enjoy playing the guitar, so maybe a music class could be fun. What electives are you taking?

Aria:: I registered for photography and French. The photography course fills up fast so I signed up early. 

Guy:: Cool, I didn't know you were into photography! I bet you'll take amazing pictures.

Aria:: Thanks! I'm excited to learn more techniques and improve my skills. What other classes do you still need?

Guy:: Let me pull up my schedule...Looks like I still need a science credit. Should I take physics or chemistry?

Aria:: I took chemistry last year. The labs are fascinating but it's a lot of work memorizing the periodic table. Physics might be easier.

Guy:: Good point. I think I'll go with physics then. It leaves my afternoons open for guitar practice too!

Aria:: Sounds perfect! We should try to get the same lunch block so we can study together in the library.

Guy:: Definitely. I could use your help staying focused on homework instead of goofing off, haha.

Aria:: No problem, we can keep each other accountable. See you in class next week!
