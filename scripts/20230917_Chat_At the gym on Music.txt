Jenny: Guy meets Aria at the gym and they chat about music while working out.

Guy: Excuse me, do you know if this machine is free? 

Aria: Yes, go ahead and use it. I just finished my set.

Guy: Thanks! I'm Guy by the way. I haven't seen you here before.

Aria: Nice to meet you Guy, I'm Aria. I just joined this gym last week. 

Guy: Cool! How are you liking it so far? I've been coming here for years.

Aria: I really like it. Lots of great equipment and classes. The only thing is they play the same pop songs over and over. 

Guy: Tell me about it! I wish they'd mix up the music selection more. Gets old hearing the same tracks every time.

Aria: Definitely. I usually listen to my own music, but forgot my headphones today. What kind of music do you like to workout to?

Guy: I'm a big classic rock fan - AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, that kind of stuff. Great for pumping iron!

Aria: Nice! I'm more into instrumental music when working out. Movie soundtracks or classical. Helps me focus. 

Guy: That's cool. Variety is the spice of life when it comes to music! Hey, maybe you can give me some soundtrack recommendations sometime.

Aria: For sure! I've got plenty I could share. See you around the gym!

Guy: Sounds great, see ya!
