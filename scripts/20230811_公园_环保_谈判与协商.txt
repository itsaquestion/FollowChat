Jenny: Guy and Aria meet in the park and have a discussion about environmental issues.

Guy:: Hi Aria! Enjoying this sunny day in the park?

Aria:: Absolutely Guy. But I'm worried about all the litter I see around here. 

Guy:: I know, it's an issue. What can we do to help keep the park clean?

Aria:: We could organize a community cleanup day. I bet we could get volunteers.

Guy:: That's a great idea. Should we talk to the city council too?

Aria:: Yes! We could lobby for more trash cans in the park. 

Guy:: I like that idea. Though it costs money, which they may not have.

Aria:: Hmm, let's think of cheaper options. What about signs reminding people not to litter?

Guy:: Simple and low-cost, I like it. We could even stencil little pictures on the sidewalks.

Aria:: Ooh yes, something catchy. That will stick in people's minds. 

Guy:: This is really coming together. Education is key to changing habits.

Aria:: For sure. We need to get the whole community involved in keeping the park clean.

Guy:: I'm feeling motivated! Let's make an action plan and start talking to people.

Aria:: Sounds perfect. This park is going to be spotless and beautiful.

Guy:: I'm excited to work on this together. Little changes can really add up.

Aria:: So true. Thanks for brainstorming with me, these are great ideas!
