Jenny:: Guy and Aria, two strangers, strike up a conversation about books and movies at a cafe. They discover they have similar tastes and decide to go see a movie together.

Guy:: Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice the book you're reading. I just finished that one last week and really enjoyed it. What do you think so far?

Aria:: Oh hi! Yes, I'm really liking it a lot. The author has such a unique writing style. Are you a big reader? What other books would you recommend?

Guy:: Definitely. Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. Some other good books I've read recently are The Silent Patient, Shuggie Bain, and The Nightingale. What about you? Got any favorites you'd suggest?

Aria:: The Silent Patient is fantastic! I also loved The Song of Achilles and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Oh and Where the Crawdads Sing is beautifully written. 

Guy:: Great choices! It seems we have pretty similar taste in books. I don't meet many people our age who are into reading as much as I am. We should exchange some other recommendations sometime.

Aria:: I agree, it's hard to find fellow book lovers. Hey, since we both clearly love books and reading, would you want to go see that new book-to-movie adaptation Together next weekend maybe? 

Guy:: That sounds great! I've been wanting to see that. Are you free Saturday evening? We could grab dinner before too if you're up for it.

Aria:: Saturday works perfectly! Here, let me give you my number so we can finalize plans. It was so nice chatting with you!

Guy:: You too! I'm looking forward to Saturday. Talk soon!
