Jenny: Guy and Aria, a couple, discuss which movie to watch at the cinema, weighing options based on their favorite actors.

Guy: Hi Aria, have you decided on a movie for our date tonight? Any ones with your favorite actress Sandra Bullock in them?

Aria: Hi Guy! Hmm not sure yet - she's not in anything playing now. What about that spy movie with Tom Cruise? I heard you like his action films. 

Guy: Yeah he's great, but I'm not in the mood for too much action tonight. What do you think of that new rom-com with Jennifer Lawrence? I know you love her!

Aria: Oh that's right, I've been wanting to see that! Her movies are always so funny. Should we watch the 7pm showing? 

Guy: Sounds perfect! I'll get the tickets and snacks if you want to grab our seats when we get there.

Aria: It's a deal! I can't wait, thanks for suggesting it - a rom-com is just what I need tonight. 

Guy: Me too, especially with you! I love our movie nights together.

Aria: Aww me too, you're the best! This is going to be fun.

Jenny: The couple agrees on a lighthearted romantic comedy starring Aria's favorite actress. They look forward to their movie date night together.
