Jenny: Guy and Aria discuss what clothes to bring on their upcoming vacation.

Guy: Aria, I'm trying to figure out what to pack for our trip. How's the weather going to be?

Aria: I checked and it looks like it'll be pretty warm and sunny during the day but can get cool at night. Bring some shorts and t-shirts but also long pants and a jacket.

Guy: Ok, thanks. Do you think I should bring that new Hawaiian shirt I got? I'm not sure it's really my style but it seems good for a tropical place.

Aria: Hmm I don't love that shirt on you to be honest. It's a bit loud. Maybe pack it but bring some solid color shirts too. Oh and don't forget your bathing suit!

Guy: Good point about the Hawaiian shirt. I'll pack it but rely more on basics. What kinds of outfits are you bringing? I still need ideas.

Aria: I'm keeping it casual - shorts, tank tops, maxi dresses, sandals. And I got a new sun hat that's so cute! I'm excited to wear it.

Guy: Maxi dresses sound perfect for the warm weather. I should get a sun hat too. Do you have any suggestions on stores or styles I should check out? 

Aria: I just got mine online but maybe we could go shopping together this weekend? We still need to get sunscreen and other travel supplies too.

Guy: Shopping together sounds great. I'd love your help picking out some vacation outfits. This trip is going to be awesome!

Aria: For sure! I can't wait to relax on the beach and explore the area. Our trip is going to be amazing.
