Jenny:: Guy and Aria chat about their hobbies and travel experiences while relaxing in the park.

Guy:: Lovely day today isn't it? I love coming to the park on weekends.

Aria:: Yes, the weather is perfect for being outside. Do you come here often?

Guy:: I try to. It's a nice break from my desk job. What about you? Are you enjoying the weekend?

Aria:: Definitely. I'm happy to get out and enjoy nature when I can. I travel a lot for work so I appreciate downtime.

Guy:: Oh where do you travel for work? That sounds interesting. 

Aria:: All over really - Europe, Asia, the US. It's tiring but I do enjoy exploring new places. How about you, do you travel much?

Guy:: I wish! I only take a few trips a year as I can't get away from the office too often. Where has been your favorite destination?

Aria:: Impossible to choose! Iceland was incredible though. The scenery was breathtaking...
