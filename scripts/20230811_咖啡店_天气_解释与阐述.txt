Jenny: Guy and Aria meet at a cafe on a cold winter day to catch up over coffee.

Guy:: Brrr, it's freezing today! I can't believe how cold it's gotten all of a sudden.

Aria:: I know, I'm still getting used to these below freezing temperatures. At least we can warm up with a hot coffee inside.

Guy:: For sure. I heard on the news that a cold front is passing through our area. That's why it dropped so quickly in the last day or two. 

Aria:: Ah I see, that makes sense. The weatherman did say to expect an abrupt temperature change. Though I didn't think it would be quite this cold!

Guy:: Me neither! I totally underdressed for this. I thought my light jacket would be enough but I'm regretting it now.

Aria:: Tell me about it. I'm just glad I wore boots today or else my feet would be frozen. Oh, and a scarf too - that helps.

Guy:: Good call. I should start keeping some warmer accessories in my car for days like these. It's only November, we still have a whole winter ahead of us!  

Aria:: Very true. We're in for a lot more frigid weather before spring, so may as well prepare. At least the sunshine helps take the edge off the cold a bit.

Guy:: That's one nice thing about winter - the crisp, clear skies. And the holidays too of course! Are you going anywhere special this year?

Aria:: Well, my family's planning a ski trip up north for Christmas. Other than that, just staying local. What about you? Any fun travel plans?

Guy:: Oh cool, a ski vacation sounds awesome! I don't have any major trips coming up, but maybe a short getaway some weekend. Somewhere warmer hopefully!

Aria:: Haha yes, that's a good idea! We'll have to escape the cold when we can this winter. For now though, let's just enjoy our coffee indoors. Cheers to staying warm!

Guy:: Cheers! Here's to the start of winter - may we get through it in one piece!
