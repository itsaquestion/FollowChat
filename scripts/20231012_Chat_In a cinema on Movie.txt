Here is a two-step approach to designing an English dialogue between Guy and Aria in a cinema, with the topic of solving a movie problem, for B1 level students to practice conversational English:

Step 1:

Jenny: Guy and Aria are discussing an issue with the movie they are trying to watch in the cinema. 

Guy: Excuse me, there seems to be something wrong with the screen. The picture is very blurry.

Aria: You're right. It's hard to see what's happening. Should we tell someone who works here?

Guy: Yes, let's go to the lobby and find an employee to help us. This is really frustrating. 

Aria: I agree. I was looking forward to this movie all week. I hope they can fix it quickly.

Guy: Me too. I already bought the tickets and snacks. Let's go get help now.

Aria: Okay, good idea. Hopefully it won't take too long to fix.
