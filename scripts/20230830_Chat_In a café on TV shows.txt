Jenny: Guy strikes up a conversation with his server Aria about TV shows, but it takes an unexpected turn when the weather comes up.

Guy: Hi Aria, how's your day going so far? Have you watched any good shows lately?

Aria: Pretty steady day so far, thanks. I just started watching that new drama on Netflix. Have you seen it? 

Guy: No I haven't! I've been meaning to though. Is it any good?

Aria: I'm really enjoying it so far. Great characters and plot twists. You should check it out.

Guy: Cool, I'll add it to my list! Hey, random question - what's your take on this weather we've been having? 

Aria: Oh man, don't even get me started on the weather! The forecast said sunny skies but it's been so gloomy all day.

Guy: I know, I was hoping to get outside but had to change my plans. At least it's perfect weather for staying in and watching shows!

Aria: Too true! Nothing better than curling up inside on a rainy day and binge watching something. 

Guy: For sure. Well hopefully the forecast improves for this weekend. Fingers crossed we'll get some sunshine!

Aria: That would be amazing. I could really use a nice sunny day. Enjoy the rest of your meal!

Guy: Thanks, you too! See you next time.
