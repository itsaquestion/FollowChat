Jenny: Guy and Aria are studying in the library and start chatting about their travel plans for the summer break.

Guy: Hey Aria, have you decided where you want to travel this summer? I'm trying to plan a trip.

Aria: Not yet. I'd love to visit somewhere new and exciting. Do you have any ideas?

Guy: I was thinking about backpacking around Southeast Asia. Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia - what do you think? 

Aria: That sounds amazing! I've always wanted to see Angkor Wat. But wouldn't it be more fun to travel together? We could be tour buddies.

Guy: Yeah, you're right. It would be way better to have a friend along. Should we start looking at flights? I'm free in July and August.

Aria: Me too! Let's definitely book something. We'll have to start planning our itinerary. I can't wait to try all the local foods. This is going to be the best trip ever!

Guy: Awesome, I'm getting excited! We'll have to pack light though - just the essentials. This calls for a celebration, want to head to the cafe after this? My treat!

Aria: I'd love to! Let's go, I could use a study break. Southeast Asia here we come! This summer is going to be unforgettable.
