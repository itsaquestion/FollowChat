Jenny:: Guy strikes up a conversation with Aria at the gym about their plans for the weekend.

Guy:: Hi there! Getting in a workout before the weekend?

Aria:: Yeah, trying to get it in before I'm busy all weekend. What about you? Any fun plans?

Guy:: I'm hoping to play some pickup basketball if the weather holds up. Do you play any sports?

Aria:: Not really, but I do enjoy swimming when I get the chance. It's a great full body workout. 

Guy:: For sure! I should incorporate more swimming into my routine. Do you swim laps or is it more recreational?

Aria:: Usually just recreational at the pool or beach. It's a nice way to unwind. What kind of basketball do you normally play? Competitive or just for fun?

Guy:: Mostly just casual games with friends, but I like the competition too. Gets me motivated to improve my skills.

Aria:: That's great you have a group to play with regularly. Team sports can be really rewarding. 

Guy:: Definitely! It's a good social activity too. Well, have a great weekend! Enjoy your swim session.

Aria:: Thanks, you too! Have fun with basketball if you get a game together.
