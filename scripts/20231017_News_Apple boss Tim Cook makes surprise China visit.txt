Aria: Apple boss Tim Cook makes surprise China visit. Apple's CEO Tim Cook made a surprise visit to China, his second trip this year. He met with gamers in Chengdu and visited Apple's Taikoo Li store to see young players of Tencent's popular game, Honour of Kings. In an interview with China Daily, Cook expressed his hopes for Chinese developers to succeed in creating software for Apple's new Vision Pro augmented reality headset. However, Apple's operations in China have been impacted by Covid and US-China tensions, leading to production challenges and lower demand for the latest iPhone model. Despite this, Chinese tech giant Baidu has recently released its latest AI model, Ernie 4.0, which it claims is comparable to OpenAI's GPT-4 system. However, AI developers in China face strict regulations, as demonstrated when the BBC's earlier version of Ernie deflected sensitive questions about Tiananmen Square and a jailed Communist Party figure.
