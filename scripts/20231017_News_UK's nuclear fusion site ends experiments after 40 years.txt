Aria: UK's nuclear fusion site ends experiments after 40 years. The JET fusion laboratory in Oxford, UK, will be ending its experiments after 40 years of research. The laboratory was established in 1983 and has been working towards achieving nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy. Fusion is the process that powers the Sun and other stars, and it involves combining light atoms to release energy. JET has been successful in producing the most energy from a fusion experiment and has made significant progress in the field. However, the goal of producing enough energy to power homes is still far away.JET has faced challenges and delays, with experiments being suspended for years in the mid-2000s. The site will now undergo decommissioning and analysis of the reactor materials to help improve other fusion sites. The UK government has decided to pursue a domestic fusion energy strategy instead of associating with the EU's Euratom programme, and has committed to spending Â£650m on a new prototype fusion energy plant called STEP. This plant is expected to start operations in the early 2040s.
