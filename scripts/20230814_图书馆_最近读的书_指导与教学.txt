Jenny:: Guy, an English teacher, talks with his student Aria about a book she recently read to work on her English skills. He gives her advice on getting the most out of reading.

Guy:: Hi Aria! What book did you read recently to work on your English?

Aria:: Hi Guy. I just finished reading The Kite Runner. It was so good but also challenging. 

Guy:: That's a great choice! Reading novels helps build vocabulary. What did you find most difficult?

Aria:: The descriptions were very vivid but some words were unfamiliar. Also the plot twists were surprising.

Guy:: When you come across new words, try writing them down and looking them up. This will expand your vocabulary.

Aria:: That's a good idea. Are there other reading tips you recommend?

Guy:: Yes, try reading out loud, especially the dialogues. This improves pronunciation. 

Aria:: I never thought of that. Reading out loud sounds helpful!

Guy:: Also, consider reading books you've already read in your native language. You'll know the plot already.

Aria:: Wow, reading books I know seems like it would be less overwhelming. 

Guy:: Absolutely. And don't look up every unknown word. You can often infer the meaning from context.

Aria:: That makes sense. I think these tips will really help my reading improve. Thank you!

Guy:: You're welcome! Keep up the reading and let me know if you have any other questions.

Jenny:: Guy gave Aria some useful advice on getting the most out of reading to improve her English skills.
