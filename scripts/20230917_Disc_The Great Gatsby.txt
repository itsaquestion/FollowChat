Jenny: Guy and Aria discuss the classic American novel The Great Gatsby, including its themes, characters, and literary significance. 

Guy: Published in 1925, The Great Gatsby is considered one of the great American novels. Written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the novel is set in New York during the Roaring Twenties. The protagonist is Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic millionaire who throws extravagant parties at his Long Island mansion. He is obsessed with Daisy Buchanan, a married woman from his past with whom he hopes to rekindle a romance. The novel explores themes of idealism, decadence, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess. Through the tragic story of Gatsby and his ill-fated love, Fitzgerald provides a vivid snapshot of American society and culture during the jazz age. The novel's poetic writing style, symbolic structure, and depiction of the jazz age helped cement its reputation as a masterwork of 20th century fiction. It remains one of the most widely read and studied American classics.

Aria: I agree it's a great American novel. What did you think of the main character Gatsby? Did you sympathize with him?

Guy: I had mixed feelings about Gatsby. On one hand, his relentless pursuit of his dream was romantic in a way. But his obsession with the past and Daisy seemed delusional.

Aria: That's a good point. He's a flawed character, but compelling nonetheless. What about the theme of social class in the novel?

Guy: Fitzgerald portrays the divide between old money and new money. The Buchanans represent the established wealthy class, while Gatsby is seen as a parvenu. 

Aria: Right, the old money crowd looks down on him even though he has a lavish mansion and throws decadent parties. Anything else strike you about the novel?

Guy: The symbolic role of the green light at the end of Daisy's dock was powerful. It represents Gatsby's longing for the past and his unattainable dream. Fitzgerald's prose is so evocative too.

Aria: I agree, his writing style makes the novel really vivid and imaginative. The Great Gatsby definitely lives up to being called a classic of American literature.
