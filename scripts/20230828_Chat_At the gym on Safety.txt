Jenny:: Guy the gym trainer talks to his new trainee Aria about important safety precautions during her workout routine.

Guy:: Hi Aria! I'm Guy, your new personal trainer. Before we start your workout, I wanted to go over some important safety tips.

Aria:: Sounds good, thanks! I'm excited to get started but want to make sure I'm being safe.

Guy:: Great! First, always warm up for 5-10 minutes before strength training or cardio. This prevents injuries. 

Aria:: Got it, warming up is key. Should I stretch too?

Guy:: Yes exactly! Stretching is part of a good warm up routine. Also, use proper form and go slow with new exercises. Don't sacrifice form for speed.

Aria:: Good point. I'll focus on form over speed, especially as I'm learning the moves. 

Guy:: Also, make sure you stay hydrated! Drink water before, during and after your workout. Dehydration can cause dizziness.

Aria:: I'll bring a water bottle next time. Anything else I should know?

Guy:: Let me know if an exercise causes pain. We can modify to prevent injury. And don't forget to cool down and stretch afterwards!

Aria:: Will do. Thanks for going over all of this - I feel ready to start safely!

Guy:: You're welcome! Safety is key. Let me know if you have any other questions!
