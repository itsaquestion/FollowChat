Jenny:: Guy tries to encourage Aria during a tough workout at the gym.

Guy:: This last set, you've got this! Just a few more reps.

Aria:: I don't know if I can. My legs are burning! 

Guy:: You're so close! Think how awesome you'll feel after finishing.

Aria:: Ugh, I'm exhausted. Can we take a break?

Guy:: No way! Rest between sets, not during. Keep pushing, I believe in you!

Aria:: Okay, I'll try. But if I collapse, it's your fault!

Jenny:: Aria struggles but keeps going with Guy's motivation. 

Guy:: Come on, dig deep! Give it everything you've got!

Aria:: I did it! I can't believe I finished the workout. Thank you for pushing me.

Guy:: I knew you could do it! I'm so proud of you. Now go refuel with a protein shake.

Aria:: I couldn't have done it without your encouragement. You always know how to keep me motivated.

Guy:: What are gym buddies for? We push each other to be our best. Nice job today!
