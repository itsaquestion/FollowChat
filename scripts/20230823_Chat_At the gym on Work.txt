Jenny:: Guy and Aria meet at the gym and chat about their jobs and workout routines during a break between sets. Their conversation starts casually but takes an unexpected turn.

Guy:: Hey, how's it going? I'm Guy. Mind if I grab the bench next to you?

Aria:: Not at all, I'm Aria. Nice to meet you.

Guy:: Likewise. Do you come here often? I think I've seen you around.

Aria:: Yeah, I try to hit the gym 3-4 times a week. Helps me destress from work. How about you?

Guy:: Same here! I work long hours at my accounting firm so the gym is my escape. 

Aria:: Accounting, huh? I'm in finance, so I totally get the long hours. What do you like to focus on here?

Guy:: Mainly weights and cardio. I'm trying to get toned for an upcoming beach vacation. How about you? Your arms look pretty defined!

Aria:: Thanks! I'm training for a bodybuilding competition so my routine is intense - lots of heavy lifting plus cardio. 

Guy:: Wow, a competition? That's really impressive. You must be so dedicated to your training. 

Aria:: I am. It's my passion! Some think it's strange for a woman but I love pushing my body to the limit. What about you - any big fitness goals?

Guy:: Haha not like competing or anything. But I'd love to be able to do 10 clean pull-ups. I can barely manage 3 right now!

Aria:: Hey 10 pull-ups is a great goal! I can help you with that if you want - I'm sort of an expert on back and arms.

Guy:: That would be amazing. I could really use the help!

Aria:: For sure, us gym people need to stick together. I'll write up a program to get your pull-ups up to 10. Let's exchange numbers and we can connect on this.

Guy:: Sounds perfect. I really appreciate you offering to help. I look forward to working out together!

Aria:: Me too! I'm always happy to motivate a fellow fitness buff. This is going to be fun.
