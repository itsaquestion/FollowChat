Aria: No room for tax cuts or spending rises, IFS think tank warns. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has issued a warning that there is no space for tax cuts or spending rises before the next election. According to the think tank, the UK is in a difficult fiscal situation, and any pre-election tax cuts could lead to a prolonged recession. The IFS also predicts that the tax burden will increase significantly, with 4.5 million more people being pushed into higher income tax thresholds by 2028.The IFS has calculated that the decision to freeze tax thresholds for six years will result in a tax rise of £52 billion a year by 2028. This is much higher than the original forecast of £8 billion a year. The think tank also cautions that the national debt, which is already close to 100% of national income, will remain high due to poor growth and high spending on debt interest. This means that there is little room for either tax cuts or spending increases, despite record high taxes and government revenues expected to exceed non-interest spending for the first time in a generation.
