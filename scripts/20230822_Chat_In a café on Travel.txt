Jenny:: Guy is a frequent customer at Aria's cafe, and they chat about his upcoming work trip.

Guy:: Hello Aria! I'll have my usual coffee please. 

Aria:: Coming right up Guy! Are you excited for your trip to London next week?

Guy:: Yes, looking forward to it! I'm going there for a work conference. Have you ever been?

Aria:: I went there a few years ago actually. It's a fantastic city with so much to see and do.

Guy:: That's great to hear. This will be my first time visiting. Any recommendations on things I should do when I'm not in conferences?

Aria:: Definitely take a walk through Hyde Park and visit some of the free museums. Also take a ride on the London Eye for amazing views!

Guy:: Those all sound great, I'll add them to my list! I only have a few free evenings so I want to make the most of it.

Aria:: Be sure to try some classic British foods too like fish and chips. Oh and stop by a pub for a pint!

Guy:: Now you're speaking my language! I love trying local foods and drinks when I travel. Thanks for all the tips!

Aria:: My pleasure! Here's your coffee, enjoy. Let me know if you need any other London advice before your trip!

Guy:: Will do, thanks Aria! I'm sure with your recommendations it will be a great trip.
