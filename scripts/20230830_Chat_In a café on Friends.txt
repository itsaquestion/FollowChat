Jenny: Guy and Aria, a couple, chat in a cafe about their friends and how that impacts their work life.

Guy: Hey Aria, I just ran into our friend James downtown. He said he might be getting a promotion soon.

Aria: Oh really? That's great news for him. He's been working hard for that job. 

Guy: Yeah he deserves it. Though it made me think about our other friends who seem stuck in their careers. Like Sam - he's been complaining about his boss for months but hasn't done anything to change jobs.

Aria: I know, I feel bad for Sam too. But some people need time to make big changes like that. Not everyone can switch jobs as easily as you did last year. 

Guy: True, I was lucky finding my new job so quickly. Still I wish I could help motivate Sam or others to take some risks.

Aria: I'm sure they appreciate you wanting the best for them. But we can't force our friends' career choices. The most we can do is be supportive, and lead by example.

Guy: You're absolutely right. As always, you know just what to say. How about we talk more about this tonight after work?

Aria: Sure, it's a date! I'll see you tonight.
