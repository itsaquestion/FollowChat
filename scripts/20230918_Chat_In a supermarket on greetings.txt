Jenny: Guy goes grocery shopping and has a friendly chat with the shop assistant Aria.

Guy: Good morning! Lovely day today, isn't it?

Aria: Yes, indeed! Welcome to our supermarket. How may I help you today? 

Guy: Oh I'm just browsing for now, but could you tell me where the milk is?

Aria: Of course! The dairy section is just down this aisle on the left side. Let me know if you need any other help!

Guy: Will do, thanks! Wow, I see you have a sale on produce - these avocados look delicious. 

Aria: They're very fresh - we just got them in this morning! Would you like me to weigh you a bag?

Guy: That would be great, thank you. Could I also get half a pound of the cherry tomatoes?

Aria: No problem, I'll package those right up for you! Anything else catching your eye today?

Guy: Hmm, I think that's all for now, but I'll let you know if I find anything else. Thanks for all your help!

Aria: My pleasure! We aim to give our customers the best service. Have a wonderful rest of your day!

Guy: You too - take care!
