Aria: Wages overtake inflation for first time in nearly two years. The latest news shows that wages in the UK have finally caught up with inflation after almost two years. This means that the cost of living may be getting easier for people. The increase in wages, at 7.8%, was higher than the average inflation rate of 6.7% between June and August. However, this doesn't mean that everyone is feeling the effects of this change, as there is still a big difference between how much public and private sector workers are paid. The Bank of England's target inflation rate of 2% has been exceeded, and while it is expected to slow down, it is still a concern. The number of job vacancies has also gone down, with some industries seeing a big drop in available jobs.
