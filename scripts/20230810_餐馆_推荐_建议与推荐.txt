Jenny:: Guy and Aria are having lunch at a restaurant. Aria wants to order something new and asks Guy for a recommendation.

Guy:: Hi Aria! Have you decided what you want to order?

Aria:: Not yet. I'm looking for something new. Any recommendations? 

Guy:: Hmm, since you like seafood, maybe you could try the salmon. I had it last week and it was delicious.

Aria:: Salmon sounds good. Is it grilled or baked?

Guy:: It's oven-baked and topped with a creamy dill sauce. The sauce makes it really tasty. 

Aria:: Okay, baked salmon it is! What are some of the other popular dishes here?

Guy:: The chicken parmesan is one of their signature dishes. It's a breaded chicken breast topped with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella.

Aria:: Mm, that sounds tempting too. I do love Italian food. What about pasta dishes? See anything good?

Guy:: They have some great pasta options. I'd recommend the seafood linguine. It has shrimp, mussels and calamari in a light tomato sauce.

Aria:: Ooh yum, I love seafood pasta. I'll definitely keep that in mind for next time!

Guy:: Their lasagna is excellent too. It's made fresh daily with layers of pasta, ground beef, tomatoes and cheese. Really hearty and delicious. 

Aria:: You're making me hungry describing all this food! I think I'll stick with the salmon today though. Thanks for the recommendations!

Guy:: No problem! Hope you enjoy your meal. Let me know what you think of the salmon.

Aria:: Will do! I appreciate you steering me towards something new. It's fun trying different dishes.

Guy:: For sure, that's one of the best parts of dining out. Getting to sample different cuisines and flavors.

Aria:: Exactly! It helps me discover new favorites. Expanding food horizons is important. 

Guy:: I agree, going outside your comfort zone leads to pleasant surprises sometimes. Keeps dining exciting.

Aria:: So true! I'm glad we're on the same page about trying new foods. Makes me look forward to our next meal!

Guy:: Me too, already thinking about what delicacies I can recommend to you next time! Happy eating!

Aria:: Thanks, you too! This salmon is calling my name. Talk to you later!
