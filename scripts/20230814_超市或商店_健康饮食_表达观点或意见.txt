Jenny:: Guy and Aria meet at the supermarket and discuss their views on healthy eating.

Guy:: Hi Aria! Fancy seeing you here. Shopping for anything special today?

Aria:: Hi Guy! Not really, just picking up some groceries. I'm trying to eat healthier these days. 

Guy:: That's a great idea. Any tips you'd recommend for healthy eating? I could use some inspiration.

Aria:: Sure! I've been trying to cut back on processed foods and eat more fruits, veggies and whole grains. And drinking lots of water.

Guy:: Makes sense. I really should cut back on junk food. But it's so hard to resist temptation at the supermarket surrounded by chips and chocolate!

Aria:: I know what you mean! Sticking to the perimeter of the store helps - that's where the fresh produce is. And I make a list so I don't impulse buy. 

Guy:: Smart thinking. Maybe I'll try meal prepping too so I have healthy snacks and lunches ready to grab and go.

Aria:: Meal prep is so helpful. I often do big batches of soups or grains like quinoa that last a few days. 

Guy:: Any go-to healthy recipes you'd recommend? I'm not much of a cook.

Aria:: Start simple with things like salad with grilled chicken or salmon. And roasted veggies are easy too - just olive oil, salt, pepper and roast at 400F.

Guy:: Got it, that sounds manageable even for me. Appreciate all the tips! Hopefully I can get on track with healthier habits.

Aria:: You're welcome! Let me know if you want any other recipe ideas. Sticking with it gets easier over time.

Guy:: Will do, thanks Aria! I better go track down some salad ingredients. See you around!

Aria:: Sounds good, see ya! Happy healthy shopping!
