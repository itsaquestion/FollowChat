Jenny:: Guy introduces the history and architecture of the Eiffel Tower to Aria, and they discuss its significance as a landmark.

Guy:: Standing at 324 meters tall, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic landmarks in Paris, France and the world. It was designed and constructed by Gustave Eiffel and his team of engineers as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair. Built with an iron lattice design, it was the tallest structure in the world at the time and considered an architectural marvel. Though controversial at first, it has become a global cultural symbol of France. Over 200 million people have visited the tower since its opening. Its three levels contain restaurants, observation decks, a broadcasting tower, and more. With its intricate steelwork and grand scale, the Eiffel Tower demonstrates the industrial ingenuity of the late 19th century. It represents human progress and achievement.

Aria:: What an impressive structure! I'd love to visit it someday. How long did it take to build the Eiffel Tower?

Guy:: Construction took just over two years, from 1887 to 1889. It was built to stand for only 20 years actually, but it proved so valuable as a radiotelegraph station that it stayed in place. 

Aria:: That's amazing it has lasted over 130 years now. I can only imagine what it was like seeing it for the first time back then. Did people in Paris like it when it was first built?

Guy:: Not everyone. At first many Parisians actually protested against the tower, thinking it looked out of place or like an eyesore. But once completed, its incredible height and unique design won over the public. It soon became a sensation and Parisian icon. 

Aria:: Sometimes it takes time for people to appreciate great architecture and engineering. It really changed the whole skyline and personality of Paris.

Guy:: It certainly did. The Eiffel Tower has defined Paris ever since. It's hard to think of the city without its famous centerpiece. An engineering triumph and work of art all in one.

Aria:: I couldn't agree more! It's on my bucket list to stand at the top someday and see Paris from above.
