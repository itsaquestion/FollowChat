Jenny: Guy and Aria chat in the library about going to see a movie together.

Guy: Hi Aria! How's it going?

Aria: Hey Guy! I'm good. Just studying for our exam next week. How about you?

Guy: I'm alright. Trying not to procrastinate too much! Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?

Aria: Not really, I've been too busy with schoolwork. Did you have something in mind?

Guy: Yeah! That new superhero movie just came out. I heard it's really good. Want to go see it this weekend?

Aria: That sounds fun! I could use a study break. And I love superhero movies. 

Guy: Great! Should we go Saturday night? We could get dinner before too.

Aria: Saturday works for me. Getting dinner first is a good idea too. 

Guy: Cool, it's a date! Er...I mean, not like a date-date. Just two friends seeing a movie, haha.

Aria: Haha right, just two friends hanging out. I'm looking forward to it!

Guy: Me too! I'll buy the tickets online tomorrow. See you in class!

Aria: Awesome, see ya!
