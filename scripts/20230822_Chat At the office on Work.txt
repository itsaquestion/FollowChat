Jenny:: Guy and Aria chat at the office about an upcoming project deadline while procrastinating. 

Guy:: Morning Aria! How's the report coming along for the client presentation on Friday?

Aria:: Hey Guy. Ugh it's a mess... I'm so stressed trying to get it done on time. I still have a ton of data analysis to do. 

Guy:: I hear you. This week has been nonstop. Want to grab coffee and procrastinate for a few? 

Aria:: That sounds amazing right now. I need a break before my brain explodes! How's your part of the presentation going?

Guy:: It's getting there. I was up late working on the slides. Still need to add some charts and graphs. 

Aria:: Nice work staying late to get it done. This project has been brutal with the tight deadline. The client expects perfection as always.

Guy:: For sure. We got this though. Our team always pulls together when it counts. Oh and I almost forgot to tell you! I have big news...

Aria:: Ooo do tell! Is it the promotion you were hoping for?

Guy:: Even better! I'm going to be a dad. We just found out my wife is pregnant! 

Aria:: Oh my gosh, congratulations!! That's so exciting. You're going to be a great father. 

Guy:: Thanks! We're thrilled. Didn't expect it to happen so soon but what a blessing. 

Aria:: Wow a baby and a big presentation both next week - you have a lot going on! But let's celebrate with coffee today :)

Guy:: Absolutely! This dad-to-be needs all the coffee he can get. Appreciate you celebrating with me.

Aria:: Of course! Now let's hurry up before we change our minds and actually work haha.
