Jenny: Guy and Aria are discussing Aria's health condition at the hospital.

Guy: How are you feeling today, Aria? 

Aria: Not too good, I'm afraid. The doctor said my test results show I have an infection.

Guy: I'm sorry to hear that. Do they know what's causing it?

Aria: They think it's a bacterial infection. They've started me on some antibiotics. Hopefully they'll help me start feeling better soon.

Guy: That's good they have a treatment plan in place. Try to get some rest while you're here as well. Is there anything I can do to help make you more comfortable?

Aria: Just having you visit me helps lift my spirits. But maybe you could bring me a few things from home next time - my book, some fresh pajamas, and a pair of slippers? 

Guy: Of course, I'll put together a bag and bring it by tomorrow morning. Let me know if you need anything else. I know the hospital can be pretty dull.

Aria: Thanks, I really appreciate you coming by and offering to help. It means so much to have your support during this time.

Guy: What are families for? I'll stop by tomorrow. Get well soon!
