Jenny:: Guy and Aria meet while grocery shopping and get into a discussion about healthy eating. Their conversation takes some surprising turns as they share perspectives.

Guy:: Hey Aria, fancy seeing you here! Shopping for some healthy foods?

Aria:: Hi Guy! Yeah, I'm trying to eat better these days. How about you? Picking up anything good?

Guy:: I'm attempting to go vegetarian actually. It's been sort of hard giving up meat, but I want to try it for health and ethical reasons. 

Aria:: Wow, vegetarian huh? That's awesome. I don't know if I could fully give up meat though. Do you find it hard getting enough protein?

Guy:: It was difficult at first, but I've found some great protein sources like beans, lentils, nuts and eggs. I also use pea protein powder in smoothies. How about you, have you made any positive changes lately?

Aria:: I've cut way back on sugar and processed foods. Reading about how bad sugar is for you really motivated me to limit it. I feel less tired during the day without those sugar crashes.

Guy:: Good for you! Cutting out excess sugar is so beneficial. I need to be better about that myself. It's easy to overdo it without realizing. Hey, we should exchange healthy recipes sometime! I've found some really tasty veggie meals.

Aria:: That's a great idea! It would be fun to trade recipe ideas. We could plan a little healthy potluck dinner party. That could give us motivation to keep eating well.

Guy:: Potluck dinner sounds awesome! It's great we can encourage each other in improving our diets. Small changes can really add up over time health-wise.

Aria:: For sure! Having a friend to discuss this stuff with makes it feel more manageable. We've got this healthy eating thing down. Just takes some adjustments. Anyway, I should get back to shopping. Let's set up that potluck soon! 

Guy:: You got it, talk to you later Aria! Excited for our healthy hangs.
