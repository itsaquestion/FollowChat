Jenny:: Guy runs into his neighbor Aria while shopping. They start chatting about the weather and their weekend plans.

Guy:: Hi Aria! Fancy seeing you here. Looks like we had the same idea to get some shopping done today.

Aria:: Hey Guy! Yes, I'm just picking up a few things. Can you believe this weather lately? The forecast said it's supposed to rain all weekend. There goes my plan to work in the garden.

Guy:: I know, this weather is so disappointing. I was hoping to take my boat out this weekend but that's not happening now with all the rain. Hopefully it clears up a bit next week. Do you have any fun plans besides the gardening?

Aria:: Not really, I'll probably just catch up on some reading and TV shows. Maybe I'll invite some friends over for dinner one night if the weather permits. What about you? Got any exciting plans?

Guy:: My brother is coming into town next weekend so that should be fun. We'll probably check out some of the new restaurants around town. Maybe we'll see you out and about! Are you going to the summer festival this year? 

Aria:: That sounds like a nice weekend! I went to the festival a couple years ago. It was a good time but so crowded! I'm not sure if I'll go again this summer or just see what other events are happening around town. We should meet up though if our schedules allow! It's always nice catching up with you.

Guy:: For sure! Well I better get back to my shopping but let's definitely plan to meet up soon. Enjoy the rest of your weekend!

Aria:: You too! See you around the neighborhood!
