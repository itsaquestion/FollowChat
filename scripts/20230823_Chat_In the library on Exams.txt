Jenny:: Guy and Aria are studying in the library before their big exam. They discuss the exam and make plans for the weekend.

Guy:: I can't believe our history exam is already next week. I feel so unprepared.

Aria:: I know, time has flown by. But we've been studying hard, I'm sure we'll do fine. What are your plans this weekend? 

Guy:: Honestly, I think I'll be in the library the whole weekend studying. This exam is worth so much of our grade. 

Aria:: You're right, it's really important. But don't forget to take breaks! We could grab coffee on Saturday morning before hitting the books again.

Guy:: That's a great idea. A study break would probably help me stay focused. And coffee is just what I need right now!

Aria:: Me too! I also wanted to review the chapters on World War II. I'm still confused about some of the dates. Want to have a study session together?

Guy:: Sure, that would be really helpful. We could quiz each other on key facts. Let's meet Saturday afternoon at the library after coffee. 

Aria:: It's a plan! Working together will make studying a bit more fun too.

Guy:: For sure! I'm feeling better about the exam already.
