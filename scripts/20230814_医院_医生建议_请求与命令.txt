Jenny:: Guy injures his ankle and goes to the hospital with his sister Aria. The doctor examines Guy and gives advice.

Doctor:: Let me take a look at that ankle. Can you try rotating it for me?

Guy:: Ouch, that really hurts when I try to turn it. I think I sprained it playing basketball.

Doctor:: It does look swollen. I'll wrap it and give you a prescription for anti-inflammatories. 

Aria:: How long until he can play sports again, doctor?

Doctor:: He should stay off it completely for two weeks. After that, ease back into exercise slowly.

Guy:: Two whole weeks?! I have a big game next weekend that I have to play in.

Doctor:: I would strongly advise against that. Further injury could lead to chronic issues.

Guy:: But coach is counting on me! Can't I just tape it up and power through?

Aria:: Guy, don't be stupid. Listen to the doctor. Your health is more important. 

Guy:: Ugh fine. I guess you're right. 

Jenny:: The doctor continues advising Guy on care for his injury. Guy reluctantly agrees to follow the doctor's orders.

Doctor:: Keep it elevated when possible and apply ice for 15 minutes a few times a day. Let me know if the pain gets worse.

Guy:: Ok doc. I'll take it easy on the ankle. But this better heal fast!

Doctor:: Patience and rest are key. No taking shortcuts with the recovery process. 

Aria:: I'll make sure he listens, doctor. He can be stubborn but I'll get him to comply.

Guy:: Hey! I'm sitting right here you know. But yeah, I promise to follow the instructions.

Doctor:: Glad to hear it. I'm sure you'll be back on the court before you know it.
