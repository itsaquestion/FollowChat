Jenny:: Guy and Aria are shopping for groceries and discussing prices.

Guy:: Hi Aria! Fancy seeing you here. 

Aria:: Hey Guy! Yeah, I'm just picking up some things for dinner. Looks like you're doing some shopping too.

Guy:: Yup, trying to get ingredients for a few meals this week. Have you noticed how expensive the produce has gotten lately?

Aria:: Ugh I know, the prices are really high right now. The organic veggies are so expensive. 

Guy:: For real. I'm trying to stick to a budget but it's tough with how much everything costs now.

Aria:: Totally. We should try to plan our shops better to save money. Maybe make a list and only buy what we need.

Guy:: That's a great idea. We could also try some different stores to compare prices.

Aria:: Yeah! We could check the flyers and go where the sales are. 

Guy:: Good plan. It's silly to pay more than we need to. Let's exchange numbers and we can let each other know if we see any good deals.

Aria:: Sounds good! We can team up to find the best prices on groceries.

Guy:: For sure. It's always good to have a shopping buddy to strategize with!

Aria:: Haha yes! We've got this. Talk soon!

Guy:: Talk to you later. Happy bargain hunting!
