Jenny: Guy and Aria chat in the park about their shared hobby of travel. They reminisce about past trips and discuss plans for future adventures.

Guy: Hey Aria! Fancy seeing you here. How's it going?

Aria: Guy, hi! I'm good. Just out for a stroll. How about you?

Guy: Same here. Enjoying this weather before winter sets in. Been up to anything fun lately?

Aria: Not much, sadly. I've barely traveled at all this year with everything going on. How about you?

Guy: I hear you. My last trip was back in March. I'm really missing it. At least we have memories of better times, right? 

Aria: For sure! Remember that backpacking trip in Thailand? The beaches were amazing.

Guy: That was such a blast! I'd love to go on a similar adventure. Maybe somewhere in South America next.

Aria: Ooh yes, I've been wanting to visit Peru or Argentina. We should look into it once this pandemic calms down.

Guy: Absolutely! It would be so cool to hike Machu Picchu together. We'd get some epic photos.

Aria: That's the dream! For now I'll settle for weekend road trips nearby, but I can't wait to travel more in the future.

Guy: Me too. It gives me something fun to look forward to. We'll just have to swap travel stories in the meantime to get our fix!

Aria: It's a deal! There's always more places to explore. Let's start planning our next big international trip. More adventures await!

Guy: I'm so in! This will give us an excuse to meet up and talk travel. It's too much fun dreaming up the possibilities. 

Aria: The best part of traveling. Let's do it! I can't wait for our next destination, wherever it may be.

Guy: Same here. The world is ours to discover. For now, just being able to hang out like this is pretty great too.

Aria: Definitely. The journey starts right here at home.
