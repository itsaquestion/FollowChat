Jenny:: Guy and Aria meet for dinner. Aria is upset about a bad day at work. Guy tries to cheer her up.

Guy:: Hi Aria! I went ahead and ordered some wine. How was your day?

Aria:: Ugh, it was awful. My boss yelled at me for a mistake that wasn't even my fault. I feel like finding a new job.

Guy:: I'm sorry to hear that. No job is worth that kind of stress. Here, have some bread to soak up the wine.

Aria:: Thanks. I know I shouldn't let it get to me but I hate being blamed for things that aren't my fault.

Guy:: I understand. But don't forget how talented you are. Any company would be lucky to have you.

Aria:: You really think so? I just feel so discouraged. My self-confidence has taken a big hit.

Guy:: This will pass. One bad day doesn't erase all your skills and accomplishments. Be patient with yourself.

Aria:: You're right. I should focus on the positive. Thanks for listening and for always knowing how to make me feel better.

Guy:: What are friends for? Here's to a better tomorrow. Now let's order, I'm starving!
