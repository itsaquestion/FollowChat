Jenny:: Guy and Aria chat about movies and actors while at the cinema. 

Guy:: I'm so excited for this movie. I've been waiting months for it to come out.

Aria:: Me too! I love the lead actor. He was incredible in his last film. What do you think of him?

Guy:: He's definitely one of my favorite actors right now. He really disappears into his roles. What about the actress? Have you seen her in anything before?

Aria:: No I haven't, but I've heard great things. She seems talented. I hope she has good chemistry with the lead actor. 

Guy:: Yeah, me too. The chemistry between the leads can really make or break a movie. Who are some of your other favorite actors?

Aria:: Well, I love Cate Blanchett. She's so versatile and captivating in everything she does. How about you? Who are your top actors?

Guy:: Good choice! I'd have to go with Leonardo DiCaprio. He always fully commits to complex roles. I also love Joaquin Phoenix. His acting has such raw emotion. 

Aria:: DiCaprio and Phoenix are fantastic! I can't wait to see what movies they make next.

Guy:: Me neither. Oh, it looks like the movie is starting soon. Let's continue this conversation afterwards!

Aria:: Sounds good! I have a feeling this will become one of my new favorite movies.
