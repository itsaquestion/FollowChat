Jenny: Guy and Aria, two friends, chat over coffee about work and upcoming travels.

Guy: Hey Aria, how's it going? Working hard or hardly working?

Aria: Oh you know, same old grind. Just trying to make it to the weekend. What about you?

Guy: Yeah tell me about it. I've been slammed at the office with this big project. But I wanted to chat with you about our trip next month.

Aria: Ah yes! I'm so excited for our little European adventure! Have you started planning and booking things? 

Guy: A bit here and there. I was thinking we could spend a few days in London, see the sights. Then make our way over to Paris.

Aria: London sounds fabulous. Let's visit Buckingham Palace and ride the London Eye! Oh and we must see the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

Guy: For sure! Those are definitely on the itinerary. And maybe we can squeeze in a quick stop in Amsterdam too before heading home.

Aria: Ooo yes, Amsterdam would be lovely! This trip is just what I need - a nice break from work and chance to explore new places.

Guy: I hear you, this will be a nice change of pace. Well I better get back to the office but let's finalize our plans over dinner next week!

Aria: Sounds perfect! Enjoy the rest of your day and we'll be jetsetting before we know it!
