Jenny:: Guy and his daughter Aria chat about sports at school while taking a walk in the park. Aria asks Guy to sign her up for track team tryouts.

Guy:: Nice day for a walk, isn't it? How's school going?

Aria:: School's good. I wanted to ask you something actually. The track team tryouts are next week. Can I sign up?

Guy:: Track team, huh? That sounds like a lot of running. Are you sure you want to do that?

Aria:: Yeah! My friends Emily and Sarah are both joining. I think it'll be really fun. 

Guy:: Well, if you're sure you can handle the training, then I don't see why not. Just promise me you'll keep your grades up.

Guy:: This weekend we'll go shopping for gear. Maybe I'll even come out and cheer you on at your first meet!

Aria:: That would be awesome! I better start stretching and training. Those tryouts are gonna be tough!
