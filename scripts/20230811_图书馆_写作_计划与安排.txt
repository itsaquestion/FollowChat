Jenny: Guy and Aria meet at the library to discuss and make plans for an upcoming writing assignment.

Guy:: Hi Aria! I'm glad we could meet up to work on Professor Lee's essay together. When is it due again?

Aria:: Hey Guy! Me too, this essay has been stressing me out. It's due next Thursday I think. Have you started yet?

Guy:: Just some initial research. Do you have a topic in mind yet? I'm struggling to narrow mine down. 

Aria:: Not really, I'm still brainstorming. This library has a great writing resources section, maybe we could browse it for inspiration?

Guy:: That's a fantastic idea! Let's head over there now and see what jumps out at us. I'd love to pick a compelling topic.

Aria:: Sounds good! I'm hoping reviewing those books sparks an interesting idea for me too. If we get stuck, we can also ask the librarian for recommendations.

Guy:: Excellent plan. While we search, maybe we can also think about the structure and outline it together. That always helps me focus my essay.

Aria:: Sure, drafting an outline first would make writing so much easier. We can bounce ideas off each other for the key points to cover. 

Guy:: Perfect. This assignment is much less intimidating when we team up. Should we aim to complete our drafts in the next few days? 

Aria:: Yes! Then we can proofread each other's essays over the weekend and submit the final versions by Monday. Supporting each other will make this a breeze.

Guy:: I agree, working together is so motivating. Let's crush this essay! I know we've got the skills and dedication. Thanks for meeting up with me.

Aria:: You're welcome! I'm thankful for the chance to collaborate. Together we'll write something great!
