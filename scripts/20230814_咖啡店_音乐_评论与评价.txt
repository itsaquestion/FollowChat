Jenny:: Guy and Aria meet at a cafe and chat about the latest music they've been listening to, sharing opinions on different genres and artists. 

Guy:: Hey Aria! How's it going?

Aria:: Great! How about you? Glad we could meet up today.

Guy:: Me too. Been listening to anything good lately?

Aria:: I just discovered this new indie folk band called The Lumineers. Their song "Ho Hey" is so catchy. 

Guy:: Cool, I'll have to check them out. I've been on a hip hop kick myself. The new Kendrick Lamar album is fire. 

Aria:: Ooh nice. I do like Kendrick Lamar but some hip hop gets too aggressive for me. I prefer more mellow vibes.

Guy:: Yeah I get that. Who else have you been jamming to recently?

Aria:: Let's see, I added some new Taylor Swift songs to my playlist. She really knows how to write a catchy pop tune. 

Guy:: Ugh, can't stand her saccharine breakup songs. Too juvenile if you ask me.

Aria:: Haha I don't mind them for easy listening. Oh and I discovered Dermot Kennedy, such a soulful voice.

Guy:: Now that's more up my alley. Will give him a listen later. Thanks for the recommendation!

Aria:: No problem! We'll have to swap playlists. It's fun sharing new music with each other.

Guy:: For sure. Same time next week?

Aria:: You bet! See you then.
