The style will be natural daily conversation but avoiding too much slang and using standard English. As a real conversation, some digression is fine.\\n\\nNames will be before each turn followed by :: without quote marks. The dialogue will be generated directly without using any code generators. The format will be an introduction by Jenny, then exchanges between Guy and Aria. If Jenny speaks again, her name and :: will be used again.\\n\\nThere will be no inappropriate sexual content or constraint mentions.\\n\\n',\n",

As you can see, I clearly ordered a soy latte but this has regular milk in it. I'm lactose intolerant so unfortunately I can't drink this. \\n\\nAria:: You're absolutely right, I sincerely apologize. Let me replace this with a soy latte right away. Is there anything else I can get for you?\\n\\nGuy:: Well, since you're offering, I'll also take a chocolate croissant to go with the new soy latte. I don't mean to cause trouble but I was really looking forward to my coffee break.\\n\\nAria:: No trouble at all, sir! I'm very sorry for the mistake. I'll go put those orders in for you now. Please let me know if you need anything else.\\n\\nGuy:: Thank you, I appreciate you fixing this. Mistakes happen sometimes. As long as you make it right, we're good.\\n\\nAria:: Of course, sir. I'm glad I could resolve the issue. Enjoy your soy latte and croissant! Just flag me down if you need a refill or have any other questions.\\n\\nGuy:: Sounds good, thanks again!\\n\\n\",\n",
