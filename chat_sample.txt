Guy: Hey, Aria! Are you using this treadmill?
Aria: Actually, I just finished. But I've set up my program on it.
Guy: Oh, I didn't notice. Sorry about that.
Aria: It's okay. Just give me a moment to clear my settings.
Guy: Of course. By the way, have you tried that new rowing machine?
Aria: Not yet. Is it any good?
Guy: It's fantastic! Provides a full-body workout.
Aria: Sounds interesting. Maybe I'll give it a shot next time.
Guy: You should. And if you need any tips, just let me know.
Aria: Thanks, Guy. I appreciate it.
Guy: No problem. Oh, and if you're free later, there's a new yoga class at 5.
Aria: Sounds tempting, but I've got plans. Maybe next week?
Guy: Sure thing. I've heard it's really refreshing.
Aria: I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the heads up!
